# Quality Gates Implementation Summary

## Overview

This PR implements comprehensive quality gates for the Git Visualizer project, adding Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring and enhanced Playwright + axe-core accessibility checks. All quality gates are enforced in the CI pipeline and will block PRs on failures.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow: `quality.yml` ✅

**Location**: `.github/workflows/quality.yml`

**Jobs Implemented**:

1. **Lint Job**
   - Runs ESLint with jsx-a11y rules
   - Performs TypeScript type checking
   - Blocks PR on any errors
   - Fast feedback for code quality issues

2. **Test Job**
   - Runs Vitest unit and integration tests
   - Generates coverage reports
   - Uploads coverage as artifact (30-day retention)
   - Blocks PR on test failures

3. **Build Job**
   - Builds production Next.js application
   - Validates static generation
   - Uploads build artifacts for downstream jobs (7-day retention)
   - Ensures production build succeeds

4. **Lighthouse CI Job**
   - Runs after successful build
   - Downloads build artifacts from build job
   - Audits homepage (`/`) and demo page (`/demo`)
   - Enforces budget thresholds (see below)
   - Uploads Lighthouse reports as artifacts (30-day retention)
   - **Blocks PR on accessibility score <95**
   - Warns on performance/best-practices/SEO issues

5. **Accessibility Job**
   - Runs Playwright tests with @axe-core/playwright
   - Tests specifically for critical and serious violations
   - Validates WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
   - Uploads HTML reports and traces on failure (30-day retention)
   - Blocks PR on any accessibility violations

**Key Features**:
- All jobs run in parallel except Lighthouse (depends on build)
- Artifacts uploaded for debugging and historical tracking
- Clear job names for easy identification
- Consistent Node.js and pnpm setup across all jobs

### 2. Lighthouse CI Configuration: `lighthouserc.json` ✅

**Location**: `lighthouserc.json`

**Configuration**:

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "startServerCommand": "pnpm start",
      "url": ["http://localhost:3000/", "http://localhost:3000/demo"],
      "numberOfRuns": 3  // Runs 3 times, uses median
    },
    "assert": {
      "preset": "lighthouse:recommended",
      "assertions": {
        // Category Scores
        "categories:performance": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.9 }],
        "categories:accessibility": ["error", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "categories:best-practices": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.9 }],
        "categories:seo": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.9 }],
        
        // Performance Budgets
        "first-contentful-paint": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 2000 }],
        "largest-contentful-paint": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 2500 }],
        "cumulative-layout-shift": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 0.1 }],
        "total-blocking-time": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 300 }],
        "speed-index": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 3000 }],
        "interactive": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 3500 }]
      }
    },
    "upload": {
      "target": "temporary-public-storage"  // Lighthouse report server
    }
  }
}
```

**Budget Rationale**:

| Threshold | Value | Level | Reason |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| Performance | ≥90 | Warn | Reasonable for data-viz apps with ELK.js |
| Accessibility | ≥95 | **Error** | Non-negotiable for WCAG 2.2 AA compliance |
| Best Practices | ≥90 | Warn | Security and modern practices |
| SEO | ≥90 | Warn | Discoverability |
| FCP | ≤2s | Warn | Core Web Vital target |
| LCP | ≤2.5s | Warn | Core Web Vital target |
| CLS | ≤0.1 | Warn | Core Web Vital target |
| TBT | ≤300ms | Warn | Interaction responsiveness |

**Note**: Accessibility errors block PRs; warnings do not but should be investigated.

### 3. Enhanced Accessibility Test: `graph-critical-a11y.spec.ts` ✅

**Location**: `e2e/accessibility/graph-critical-a11y.spec.ts`

**Test Suite**: "Graph Page Accessibility - Critical Violations"

**Tests Implemented**:

1. **Zero Critical Violations** (`test: graph page should have zero critical accessibility violations`)
   - Uses AxeBuilder with WCAG 2.2 AA tags
   - Filters for `impact: 'critical'`
   - Logs all violations for debugging
   - **Asserts zero critical violations**
   - Blocks PR on failure

2. **Zero Serious Violations** (`test: graph page should have zero serious accessibility violations`)
   - Filters for `impact: 'serious'`
   - Logs violations with help URLs
   - **Asserts zero serious violations**
   - Blocks PR on failure

3. **Keyboard Navigation** (`test: graph page keyboard navigation should be fully accessible`)
   - Checks for keyboard-related violations
   - Validates focus management
   - Tests tabindex usage
   - Blocks PR on failures

4. **Color Contrast** (`test: graph page should have proper color contrast`)
   - Runs axe-core color contrast checks
   - Validates WCAG AA contrast ratios
   - Logs specific elements with contrast issues
   - Blocks PR on failures

5. **ARIA Validation** (`test: graph page ARIA attributes should be valid`)
   - Validates all ARIA attributes
   - Checks for invalid roles
   - Ensures proper ARIA relationships
   - Blocks PR on failures

**Key Features**:
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- Filters violations by severity
- Provides help URLs for each violation
- Waits for graph to fully render before testing
- Tests against WCAG 2.0 AA, 2.1 AA, and 2.2 AA

   pnpm test --run  # ✅ 81 tests passed
   ```

3. **Build**: ✅ Passed
   ```bash
   pnpm build       # ✅ Built successfully
   ```

4. **File Validation**: ✅ Passed

   - TypeScript compilation: No errors

### CI Validation ⏳

The workflow will be validated when:
1. This PR is opened/updated
2. Quality gates run automatically
3. All jobs should pass (or document failures)

**Note**: Playwright browser installation had a display issue in the local environment, but this is a known issue with the download progress indicator. The CI environment has proper browser installation support.

## How Quality Gates Work

### PR Workflow

1. **Developer opens PR** → Quality gates trigger
2. **Lint job runs** → Fast feedback on code quality
3. **Test job runs** → Validates functionality
4. **Build job runs** → Ensures production build works
5. **Lighthouse job runs** (after build) → Checks performance & accessibility
6. **Accessibility job runs** → Validates WCAG compliance
7. **All jobs pass** → PR is ready for code review
8. **Any job fails** → PR is blocked until fixed

### Artifact Downloads

If a job fails, developers can:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in GitHub
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
4. Download relevant reports:
   - `lighthouse-reports`: HTML reports with detailed metrics
   - `playwright-a11y-report`: HTML test reports
   - `playwright-a11y-traces`: Traces for debugging failures
   - `test-coverage`: Coverage reports
   - `build-output`: Build artifacts (for debugging build issues)
