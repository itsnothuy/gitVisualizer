# Area Instructions — Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

## Purpose
Ensure **WCAG 2.2 AA** conformance across UI and data-viz, with strong keyboard support and screen reader semantics.

## Non-negotiables
- **Keyboard**: All interactive elements are reachable and operable via Tab/Shift+Tab; visible focus states; logical order.
- **Color independence**: No information via color alone—pair with icon/shape/pattern/text.
- **SVG & ARIA**: Group related shapes with `<g>` and provide `aria-label`/`title`. Use landmark roles and relationships appropriately.
- **Reduced motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; provide motion-light rendering of graph transitions.

## Do / Don’t
**Do**
- Add automated checks where feasible; keep a manual checklist in PRs.
- Provide textual summaries for complex graphs.

**Don’t**
- Don’t hide focus; don’t rely on hover only.

## Acceptance criteria (per PR)
- A11y notes in PR description: tab order changes, labels added, motion handling.
- Playwright smoke test verifies basic keyboard navigation on the graph page.
