# LGB Core Animation Scenes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds complete core animation scenes for common Git operations to the LGB (Learn Git Branching) mode of Git Visualizer. The animation system is fully integrated with accessibility features, reduced motion support, and comprehensive testing.

## Delivered Components

### 1. Core Scene Functions (`src/viz/anim/scenes/core.ts`)
Implemented 8 animation scenes for common Git operations:

- ✅ **commit**: New node fade-in above tip; branch label slides; HEAD arrow nudges
  - Duration: ~540ms
  - Features: Fade-in animation, branch tip highlight, label positioning

- ✅ **branch create**: Label appear/disappear aligned to anchor commit
  - Duration: ~440ms
  - Features: Anchor highlight, label fade-in with inline positioning

- ✅ **branch delete**: Label fade-out animation
  - Duration: ~220ms
  - Features: Smooth fade-out, preserves commit history

- ✅ **checkout**: Animate HEAD arrow along edge to target
  - Duration: ~660ms
  - Features: Unhighlight old, move label, highlight new, supports detached HEAD

- ✅ **fast-forward**: Tip label slides along path; intermediate nodes fade in
  - Duration: ~600-800ms (variable)
  - Features: Cascading highlights, intermediate node reveal, smooth label transition

- ✅ **merge (2-parent)**: Draw temporary dashed second-parent arc → pop-in merge node
  - Duration: ~1200ms
  - Features: Dashed edge preview, merge node pop-in, parent highlights, label update

- ✅ **reset**: Safe "snap" with emphasis color; no silent node loss
  - Duration: ~660ms
  - Features: Emphasis color (accent/danger), quick snap, target highlight
  - Safety: Hard reset uses danger color; soft reset uses accent color

- ✅ **revert**: Creates new commit with danger color emphasis
  - Duration: ~980ms
  - Features: Original commit highlight, danger stroke, label movement, final pulse

### 2. Animation Mapper (`src/viz/anim/mapper.ts`)
Maps Git state diffs to animation scenes:

- ✅ **Core Types**: `GitNode`, `GitRef`, `GitState`, `GitDiff`, `GitOperation`
- ✅ **Mapping Function**: `mapDiffToScene(diff: GitDiff): AnimScene | null`
- ✅ **Helper Functions**: 
  - `findIntermediateCommits()` - for fast-forward path detection
  - `findNewCommit()`, `findNewRef()`, `findDeletedRef()` - diff helpers
  - `resolveHead()` - handles both direct and symbolic references

Supported operation mappings:
- `commit` → `sceneCommit`
- `branch-create` → `sceneBranchCreate`
- `branch-delete` → `sceneBranchDelete`
- `checkout` → `sceneCheckout`
- `fast-forward` → `sceneFastForward`
- `merge` → `sceneMerge2P`
- `reset` → `sceneReset`
- `revert` → `sceneRevert`

### 3. Test Fixtures (`fixtures/lgb/intro.json`)
Created comprehensive fixture demonstrating core scenarios:
- Initial state: single commit (c1) on main
- Operation sequence:
  1. Create commit C2 on main
  2. Create feature branch at C2
  3. Checkout feature branch
  4. Create commit C3 on feature
  5. Checkout main
  6. Create commit C4 on main
  7. Merge feature into main (creates C5 with 2 parents)

### 4. Unit Tests
Comprehensive test coverage with 75 passing tests:

#### Scene Tests (`src/viz/anim/__tests__/scenes.test.ts`)
- ✅ 24 tests covering all 8 scene functions
- ✅ Timing verification (120-480ms bounds)
- ✅ Step composition validation
- ✅ No overlapping locks
- ✅ Sequential step timing without negative times

#### Mapper Tests (`src/viz/anim/__tests__/mapper.test.ts`)
- ✅ 17 tests covering all Git operations
- ✅ Diff detection and scene mapping
- ✅ Error handling (invalid diffs, missing data)
- ✅ Detached HEAD support
- ✅ `findIntermediateCommits()` path detection

#### Engine Tests (`src/viz/anim/__tests__/engine.test.ts`)
- ✅ 20 tests (existing, still passing)
- ✅ Scene building and playback
- ✅ Input locking
- ✅ Reduced motion support
- ✅ Callback verification

#### Selector Tests (`src/viz/anim/__tests__/selectors.test.ts`)
- ✅ 14 tests (existing, still passing)
- ✅ Element targeting by data attributes

**Total: 75/75 tests passing**

### 5. E2E Tests (`e2e/animation/core-scenes.spec.ts`)
Playwright tests for integration and accessibility:
- ✅ Graph rendering and structure
- ✅ Keyboard navigation during animation lifecycle
- ✅ ARIA live region for announcements
- ✅ Zero critical accessibility violations (axe-core)
- ✅ Reduced motion preference support
- ✅ SVG structure integrity
- ✅ Visual consistency (screenshots)

### 6. Documentation (`docs/LGB_MODE.md`)
Enhanced documentation with comprehensive core scenes section:
- ✅ Scene descriptions with code examples
- ✅ Visual behavior explanations
- ✅ Timing guidelines and windows
- ✅ Safety notes (reset modes, revert behavior)
- ✅ Mapper integration examples
- ✅ Usage patterns with `useAnimation` hook

## Integration Points

### GraphView Component (`src/viz/svg/Graph.tsx`)
Already integrated with animation system:
- Imports `useAnimation` hook
- Accepts `animationScene?: AnimScene | null` prop
- Plays animations when prop changes
- Proper cleanup on unmount

Example usage:
```typescript
<GraphSVG
  nodes={nodes}
  edges={edges}
  positions={positions}
  animationScene={currentScene}
  onAnimationComplete={() => console.log('Done!')}
/>
```

## Accessibility & Reduced Motion

### A11y Features
- ✅ ARIA live region for scene announcements
- ✅ Screen reader descriptions for each scene
- ✅ Keyboard navigation remains functional during animations
- ✅ Input locking prevents conflicts
- ✅ WCAG 2.2 AA compliance verified

### Reduced Motion Support
- ✅ Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- ✅ All durations capped at ≤80ms
- ✅ Scene descriptions still announced
- ✅ Full functionality maintained

## Timing Specifications

All scenes respect consistent timing windows:
- **Very Short**: 120ms (quick transitions, snaps)
- **Short**: 220ms (standard animations, fades)
- **Medium**: 320ms (emphasis, highlights)
- **Long**: 480ms (complex movements)

**Individual scene durations:**
- commit: 540ms
- branch-create: 440ms
- branch-delete: 220ms
- checkout: 660ms
- fast-forward: 600-800ms (variable)
- merge-2p: 1200ms
- reset: 660ms
- revert: 980ms

- ❌ Rebase animation (complex, requires separate PR)
- ❌ Cherry-pick animation (requires separate PR)
- ❌ Interactive tutorials
- ❌ Overlay integration (GitHub/GitLab)
- ❌ Demo page enhancements (existing demo sufficient)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for follow-up PRs:
1. Add rebase and cherry-pick scenes
2. Interactive tutorial system using animation sequences
3. Animation playback controls (play/pause/speed)
4. Custom scene composition builder
5. Animation recording/replay for debugging
6. Performance monitoring dashboard
7. Additional timing presets (instant, slow, etc.)
